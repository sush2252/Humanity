We, the citizens of India have just crossed the Vijaya Diwas of the Indian Army, 16th December 2020. 
I was remembering the days of 1971, I was getting ready for the preparation of the Calcutta University examination and preparing to organise the 1st Rock Climbing Course of The Institute of Exploration of Kolkata.

We were worried about our crock climbing course. The news of the ceasefire of the India-Pakistan war gave us great relief. I was studying at the premises of the Indian Red Cross Society at Central Kolkata. 
The relief materials are unloading at Dumdum International ( Netaji Subash Chandra Bose International) AirPort from various parts of the world. 
I was expecting more posts will be published in our media of those days but it has not happened. Dr. Robin Chatterjee a volunteer of the Indian Red Cross Society was stationed at Raj Bhawan, Kolkata.
